This Refund Policy outlines the circumstances under which Frazor Enterprise Solutions LLP may provide a refund, the process for claiming a refund, and the responsibilities of the customer.</p>

        <h2>1. General Policy</h2>
        <p>Our refund policy is designed to be transparent and fair. Refunds are not guaranteed and are subject to the terms outlined below. Each refund request will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</p>
        <p>For subscription-based services, terms of cancellation and potential refunds will typically be governed by the specific subscription agreement entered into at the time of purchase.</p>
        <p>For project-based services or custom development, refund terms will be detailed in the specific project proposal or contract agreed upon before the commencement of work.</p>

        <h2>2. Eligibility for a Refund</h2>
        <p>You may be eligible for a refund under the following circumstances (subject to review and approval by Frazor Enterprise Solutions LLP):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Non-Delivery:</strong> If we fail to deliver the agreed-upon service or product within the stipulated timeframe and this failure is solely attributable to Frazor Enterprise Solutions LLP.</li>
            <li><strong>Major Defects:</strong> If the software or service provided has critical defects that render it unusable, and we are unable to rectify these defects within a reasonable period after being notified. The definition of "critical defect" and "reasonable period" will be determined by Frazor Enterprise Solutions LLP in consultation with the client.</li>
            <li><strong>Cancellation of Subscription (if applicable):</strong> For monthly or annual subscription services, you may be eligible for a partial refund if you cancel your subscription in accordance with the terms of your subscription agreement. Typically, refunds are not provided for the current billing cycle but future charges may be stopped. <em>[Frazor to specify actual subscription refund terms.]</em></li>
            <li><strong>Billing Errors:</strong> If you have been incorrectly billed due to an error on our part, we will issue a refund for the overcharged amount.</li>

            <li>The service has been substantially delivered or utilized.</li>
            <li>Issues arising from your own infrastructure, third-party integrations not managed by us, or your misuse of the service.</li>
            <li>Minor bugs or issues that do not significantly impede the core functionality of the service, and for which we are actively working on a resolution.</li>
